Oh and check your Bible....Jews have lived in the land of Isreal... renamed Palestine by the Roman&#39;s after they got done slaughtering that generation of Jews by the way... Jews have lived in Israel since biblical times.  The colonizers of the 19th and 20th century of the land now renamed Palestine under UN leadership ..... once again your British ancestors so maybe people of your ancestry are to blame....who left and portioned it into 2 states....for the two original peoples that had lived there for centuries... Jews and Arabs.... but the Arabs refused that state and declared war on the Jews.  So I have to laugh at your idiotic colonial argument.  Israel was created by by opposite means.... by ending British colonial control and giving the land back to the two original peoples that populated it.  One group... the Jews...took this opportunity to build a modern thriving democratic state of Israel... the other repeatedly rejected... continue to live in poverty...refuse to govern themselves responsibly and have been committing terrorist acts against Israel and calling for the extermination of Jews.

Ma le dice Haaretz, una delle più importanti testate giornalistiche israeliane.<br><br>Dall’articolo intitolato “Breve storia dell’alleanza fra Netanyahu e Hamas” <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-20/ty-article-opinion/.premium/a-brief-history-of-the-netanyahu-hamas-alliance/0000018b-47d9-d242-abef-57ff1be90000\">https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-20/ty-article-opinion/.premium/a-brief-history-of-the-netanyahu-hamas-alliance/0000018b-47d9-d242-abef-57ff1be90000</a> leggiamo:<br><br>“Molto inchiostro è stato versato per descrivere la relazione duratura - anzi, l’alleanza - fra Benjamin Netanyahu e Hamas. Eppure, il fatto stesso che ci sia stata una stretta collaborazione fra il primo ministro israeliano (con il supporto di molti della destra) e questa organizzazione fondamentalista, è improvvisamente scomparso dalle analisi più recenti: tutti parlano di “fallimenti”, “errori” e “contzeptziot” (idee fisse). Detto questo, non solo è necessario rivedere la storia di questa collaborazione, ma dobbiamo anche concludere in modo inequivoco che il pogrom del 7 ottobre 2023 aiuta Netanyahu, e non per la prima volta, a preservare il suo potere, almeno in tempi brevi”.<br><br>“Il modus operandi di Netanyahu, da quando nel 2009 è tornato ad essere primo ministro, è sempre stato e continua ad essere, da un lato, un rafforzamento del ruolo di Hamas nella striscia di Gaza, e dall’altro, un indebolimento dell’Autorità Palestinese.”<br><br>“Negli ultimi 14 anni, mentre incrementava una politica di divide-et-impera fra Cisgiordania e Gaza, Netanyahu si è opposto a qualunque tentativo, militare o diplomatico, che potesse mettere fine al regime di Hamas.”<br><br>“Per oltre un decennio, Netanyahu ha aiutato in vari modi la crescita militare e politica di Hamas. È stato Netanyahu a trasformare Hamas da una organizzazione terroristica con poche risorse a qualcosa di simile ad uno stato vero e proprio.”<br><br>“Rilasciare prigionieri palestinesi, permettere il trasferimento di denaro contante – visto che l’inviato del Qatar entra ed esce da Gaza come vuole – permettere l’importazione di una vasta gamma di beni e di materiali da costruzione, pur sapendo che molto di questo materiale servirà al terrorismo e non a costruire infrastrutture civili […] tutto questo ha creato una simbiosi fra il fiorire del terrorismo fondamentalista e la conservazione del potere di Netanyahu.”<br><br>“È importante ricordare che senza questi fondi dal Qatar (e dall’Iran), Hamas non avrebbe mai avuto i soldi per mantenere il suo regno di terrore. In pratica, l’iniezione di denaro contante dal Qatar (e non di depositi bancari, che sono facilmente tracciabili) rappresentano una pratica che Netanyahu ha supportato ed approvato, e che è servita a rafforzare il braccio armato di Hamas fin dal 2012.”<br><br>L’articolo poi spiega come, ogni volta che si sia presentata per Israele la possibilità di distruggere Hamas, Netanyahu si sia adoperato in tutti i modi perché questo non accadesse. Prosegue l’articolo: <br><br>“Nell’agosto 2019 l’ex primo ministro Ehud Barak ha dichiarato che ‘la strategia di Netanyahu è quella di mantenere Hamas vivo e vegeto, anche a costo di abbandonare i suoi cittadini [nel sud di Israele), pur di indebolire l’Autorità Palestinese di Ramallah’. Barack ha aggiunto che grazie ad Hamas, è più facile spiegare agli israeliani che non c’è nessuno con cui dialogare. Se invece l’Autorità Palestinese dovesse rafforzarsi, allora avremmo qualcuno con cui dobbiamo parlare”.<br><br>“Nello stesso anno, l’esponente del Likud, Galkit Atbaryan, ha dichiarato: “Diciamolo sinceramente, Netanyahu vuole Hamas ai suoi piedi, ed è disposto a pagare un prezzo quasi incomprensibile per ottenere questo risultato.”<br><br>“Lo stesso primo ministro [Netanyahu n.d.r.] ha accennato più volte brevemente alla sua posizione riguardo ad Hamas. Nel marzo 2019, durante una riunione del Likud dove si stava discutendo il trasferimento di fondi ad Hamas, Netanyahu disse: “chiunque si opponga ad uno Stato palestinese deve supportare i finanziamenti di Gaza, perché mantenere la separazione fra la Autorità Palestinese in Cisgiordania e Hamas a Gaza eviterà che venga creato uno stato palestinese”.<br><br>“Non illudetevi - conclude l’articolo – che, finché Netanyahu e il suo governo sono al potere, il regime di Hamas possa crollare. Ci saranno un sacco di discorsi pirotecnici sulla attuale “guerra al terrorismo”, ma sostenere Hamas per Netanyahu è molto più importante di qualche morto nei kibbutz.”<br><br>Avete capito, Belpietro Capezzone &amp; Company? Quando il saggio indica la luna, gli stolti guardano il dito. Quando Netanyahu urla contro Hamas, gli stolti guardano le vittime dei kibbutz. E non si accorgono che il vero mandante è proprio lui.<br><br>Massimo Mazzucco<br>(link all&#39;articolo originale su luogocomune.net)\n",

If you are not here to accept the American way of life and promote the Country&#39;s  general well being then you need to be deported. How do you expect to retain a Country that has been built on a specific system of Judea/Christian values, by specifically choosing people who refuse to adopt our American brand? The answer is that&#39;s the entire point! The Left is deliberately trying to destroy the Country. The whole BLM fiasco was meant to turn Americans against Blacks and create civil war. Why do you think they immediately release Black violent criminals? Its because they know that eventually they will be shot by a Cop or an armed civilian and then they get their fake racism circus. They gave that degenerate G Floyd 4 funerals, a gold lined casket, a hero&#39;s folded flag ceremony, and renamed dozens of streets after him, built dozens of memorials and statues to him. He had done NOTHING his whole life but commit violent armed crime. He had done NOTHING but be a literal crackhead and had multiple arrests for selling deadly fetnyll to kids. You seriously didn&#39;t see then what game was actually being played? You didn&#39;t see what the Left was doing when they gave a crackhead who died hours later from a massive drug overdose and coronary heart failure in the hospital a godamn heroes folded American flag ceremony to honor..........? To honor what exactly? A lifetime of crime? They allowed criminal degenerates to riot burn and loot and kill with impunity for an entire YEAR! Never once coming out to condemn the violence. They allowed them to barricade Police Officers in their own buildings and them set them on fire with Cops now trapped inside. THEY CHEERED FOR THAT! Then the now phony VP Harris set up BAIL funds to get the criminals out of jail so they could keep burning American cities down. That ALL actually happened. None of what I just said is hyperbole or opinion. It all actually took place. It was all 100% designed by the Left to topple America. They didn&#39;t count on the fact that Conservatives are the actual law abiding citizens,. The productive members of society. They figured we are all degenerates like them and we would see the obvious treachery being committed by the Left and WE would just come out guns blazing. Well, when that didn&#39;t happen they had to plan something else, and cue Jan 6th! Well, that actually didn&#39;t go the way they wanted either. So now its pro terrorist supporters and they are hoping that we fall for the bait THIS time. NOPE! We are the real Americans and we will always be here to make sure this Country NEVER falls to the COMMIE LEFT! Your reign of terror that has now destroyed multiple Countries under this Biden regime of nonsense and ANTI Americanism has come to an end. You think we will retreat and give over this Nation to a bunch of hyper confused, kool aid haired weirdos who don&#39;t even know what bathroom to use.  People who have never had a job in their lives and consider the absolute worst thing that has ever happened in the history of the universe is them getting &quot;mis gendered&quot; at McDonalds! People so profoundly unstable they NEED cry closets at their schools (indoctrination centers). People who want to shut off the worlds energy and oil/natural gas production because racisms and climate hysteria. They strongly believe that African families dying of starvation, living in literal grass huts need to somehow figure out a way to all of a sudden cough up hundreds of billions of dollars so they can drape their grass huts in solar panels and windmills. These people are using donkey dung as fuel but sure tell em they can no longer have access to cheap powerful energy and just gotta suck it up. Because the White lesbian liberals in America say so!

I continue to classify myself as a Liberal / Progressive, but honestly, these stupid, senseless, kids don&#39;t represent me, not by a long shot. I&#39;m a Canadian Liberal, and I long for the good, common sense, Social Liberalism I experienced throughout the 60s, 70s and into the 80s to a fair degree. The ideology that brought in Universal Healthcare for Canada. The ideology that stated that every human being should be provided their basics of life regardless if you could provide it for yourself or not, as basic, human, rights of survival. The ideology that stated that all minorities should be protected under the law, at a time when Civil, Women&#39;s and Gay Rights were being fought for all over North America, at the time. The type of good, common sense, Social Liberalism that created much of the modern world we enjoy today. THIS, is what I long to see again. Back then, being Liberal and Progressive was a GOOD, thing, overall. You knew what the left and liberals stood for and overall, it all, seemed right and made sense. Today, it&#39;s all, so, convoluted that no one seems to know what to think or believe any longer, and the world is suffering greatly, because of it.\n",

The sanjak was a part of the larger Damascus Eyalet or the &quot;Province of Damascus&quot;.[<br>Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered it and most of Palestine in 1832.  Gaza&#39;s port was by then inactive. <br>Virtually all of Gaza&#39;s vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation.<br>Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza,bringing more death and destruction, just barely after the city began to recover from the bubonic plague.<br>the first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities.<br>Economically and politically dominated by a number of powerful clans, particularly the Shawa, Husseini, and Sourani families.<br>The British  conquered Gaza in a 1917 battle ending Ottoman rulership.<br>Jewish Quarter of Gaza was destroyed and most of Gaza&#39;s Jewish families fled the city in 1929. <br>In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. Areas damaged in the riots underwent reconstruction mostly funded by international organizations and missionary groups - as is the case today  nearly 100 years on.<br>No Jews or Israelis on the scene yet.<br> Egypt was in control of Gaza in 1948.<br> From 1948 until 1959, Gaza was nominally under the jurisdiction of the All-Palestine Government, an entity established by the Arab League during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, purportedly as the government for a liberated Palestine.<br>Still no Israeli &quot;occupation&quot;<br>Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser severely curtailed political activity in Gaza. <br>In 1959, with the abolishment of the All-Palestine Government, Gaza officially became a part of the United Arab Republic, a union of Syria and Egypt, under the pan-Arab policy of Nasser. <br>Gaza was under direct Egyptian military governorship, which also continued upon the withdrawal of Syria from the UAR shortly afterwards.<br>No mention of Gaza being occupied.<br>in the 1967 Six-Day War the Arab nations lost Gaza to Israel. <br>Only now the term &quot;occupied&quot; is introduced.<br>In 1967 the military governor of Gaza threatened to dismiss the municipal council and cut off utility services if the local leadership was unable to force the residents of the city to turn in their weapons. This action was revoked by the Israeli military governor of the Gaza Strip.<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_the_United_Arab_Republic\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_the_United_Arab_Republic</a>\n",

After their own Europe people persecuted these European Jews. Welcomed even thought they are not Middle Eastern. They are not Semitic (yet cry anti Semitism the loudest). In fact Palestinians are Semitic. Most the Arab world is Semitic. These European Jews who call themselves Israeli are not semitic. They are European. They&#39;ve even stolen the term Semitic, when in fact they are the antisemites. It&#39;s disgraceful. They didn&#39;t want to share the land. They showed thanks to Palestine (the only country on the planet to take them) by breaking the contract the day they got off the boat and massacred Palestinians. Stole the land and implement apartheid.

The Grand Mufti (Yasser Arafat&#39;s uncle) even took a tour of an operating death during the war, escorted by two SS officers who showed him around.  So, you see, the so-called &quot;Palestinians&quot; were trying to exterminate Jews long before the 1948 creation of modern Israel.  Even in 1929, these Arabs massacred Jews.  Just look up the Hebron massacre of about 65 Jews which took place in 1929.  And please do not pay attention to &quot;Palestinian&quot; propaganda about purported atrocities, oppression, etc.  Moreover, there was never an Arab land of &quot;Palestine&quot;; and the so-called &quot;Palestinians&quot; cannot even in their own language, Arabic, pronounce the word &quot;Palestine&quot; because there is no &quot;P&quot; in Arabic.

            "Millions of articles have been written about the Palestinians who were forced to evacuate their homes because of the war they started, but very little has been written about Jews who lived in Muslim countries, were exposed to pogroms and were forced to leave the country even though they did nothing.  Tell me, please, why do you care so much about the Palestinian refugees, but you don&#39;t care at all about the millions of other refugees in the world who were forced to emigrate from their country?  Everyone is obsessed only with the Palestinian refugees, who are the most privileged in the world,&quot; declares Oren. &quot;Did you know that the UN has two branches for refugees, one that takes care of all the millions of refugees around the world, and one, UNRWA, that is only for the privileged refugees, the Palestinians?  In the long history of the Land of Israel, there was never a concept called &quot;Palestinians&quot; until the twenties of the last century.  Hundreds of pilgrims came to Israel during the last 3,000 years - Christians, Muslims and more, but never met Palestinians... Israel is the most documented piece of land in history,&quot; he says and adds: &quot;Until 1948, the Palestinians had years to establish a free Palestinian state, because they were  Under Egyptian and Jordanian rule, but they didn&#39;t do that... Later they refused to accept any offer made to them from Israel, invested all the money they received from the world in terrorism, and then cried that they were the victims.  The Palestinians have a more difficult life than us Israelis, but they can only blame themselves for that.&quot; Give me the name of one Arab village from the seventh century, when the Arabs took over the Land of Israel, until 1947, when the Arabs started a war to wipe out the Jews, that was forcibly taken over  their hand. In all those years, not one piece of land was stolen from the West. Again, if you think I&#39;m wrong, correct me and give me the name of one village that was stolen from them.<br><br>       &quot;On the other hand, I can give you many names of Jewish settlements that Arabs or Palestinians destroyed before 1948 - Hebron for example, Jews lived in Hebron for hundreds of years, and in 1929 a group of Arabs murdered 70 Jews, and the ancient Jewish settlement had to be abandoned until it returned to Jewish hands in 1967  &quot;.  Other names of places that Oren brought up in the video are Kfar Oriya, Bnei Yehuda, Kfar Mellal and more.  If we were to examine the entire Middle East and only the Palestinians were prone to violence, we would say - OK, maybe we are wrong.  But if Palestinians were violent before 1948, and almost all Muslim countries are dictatorships with a high level of violence and a low level of human rights, maybe there is a problem here.  17 of the 20 most dangerous countries for the LGBT community are Muslim. Almost all the most dangerous places in the world for Christians are Muslim. Look at the Jews: a third of them were murdered by the Nazis, they don&#39;t have an oil-rich country, they are surrounded by enemies and yet they succeed.  American money, which we use to buy military weapons against our enemies. Plus, the Palestinians get a lot more money. We succeed because we are broad-minded, think outside the box, and are non-violent.<br><br>      &quot;This is also true outside the Middle East: look at Arab Muslim communities around the world - if there are violent riots in Paris, Sweden, Rotterdam or London, are they likely to happen in the Jewish or Arab neighborhoods? Peace will only come when the Arabs change their values, when Muslim countries become democratic  ... and when homosexuals will not be thrown from rooftops in Gaza.&quot;\n",

It&#39;s the &quot;in&quot; thing to protest. <br>I&#39;m in the NYC area. Reminds me of when the unemployed were piling into the city, blocking up regular life for days. Screaming about losing their unemployment checks after 99 weeks. That they&#39;d ALL be homeless and starve. Meanwhile, they were ordering gourmet meals to be catered to their little camp out protest. Actual homeless people, tried to take some simple extras like bread. They were beat up and screamed at by the protesters, who went on the news, yelling &quot;THEY DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING TO EARN IT!!&quot; <br>🤦<br>That&#39;s exactly what happened. I&#39;m sure you could find old articles and videos, of that ridiculousness. Can&#39;t miss them, they all had T Shirts made saying &quot;Occupy Wall St.&quot;, yeah that was brilliant 🤪.<br>They are clueless, they are truly rebels without a cause. The alphabet community, if Hamas got a hold of them, would be stripped down, beaten beyond recognition but kept alive just long enough, to be thrown, head first, off a tall building. <br>The others would suffer equally horrific ends. Because Hamas isnt impressed or appreciative of their support. They are useful idiots to Hamas, nothing more. They don&#39;t value the lives of their own children.<br>Everyone is a way to a means, that&#39;s it.<br>How many more innocent people have to die before everyone realizes, this is a war between good and evil. That&#39;s been going on for thousands of years. If that&#39;s too much in the realm of faith for some, then it&#39;s positive energy verses negative energy, IDK.<br>&quot;God chose Israel, America chose God&quot; has gone viral, regardless of the endless propaganda media saying otherwise. <br>If that bothers people, im sorry but we know we are not doing this life thing on our own. We will not bow before the gods of man, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. <br>And personally, im not perfect, I&#39;m a mess just like everyone else. Perfection is not required. God wants a relationship with his children, whom he loves more than they could ever comprehend. It&#39;s ALWAYS been about the heart. And I love my Abba, with all my mine. This is a family. Everyone we meet is an estranged family member. Maybe if people understood that truth, they&#39;d treat each other differently. It&#39;s heartbreaking to see this level of hate and destruction.

Oh my God, this girl who said, “Don’t forget where you were in 1948,” should be imprisoned. How dare you use the card that the Israeli ambassador uses to justify killing sons of bitches, as Shapiro said. What&#39;s nice is that after they welcomed us to their land, we did not ask for that. Rather, they were the ones who offered us and gave us Palestinian transit papers so that we could live among them and travel with their nationality to hold meetings that would guarantee me taking the land of their ancestors. How dare they compare what Israel does for them in terms of services, such as building a wall to protect them from extinction because they are our animals? Humanity must be tamed. How did I not understand that they were working to improve their high population density rate by reducing their number? I was truly shocked by their reaction. Don’t they know that war always involves destruction? We have been doing this for 80 years. Why did no one feel our hand slapping the Palestinians day and night for the benefit of humanity? And now after... The first barbaric, barbaric attack that lasted six hours against the Jews, God’s chosen people. You compared it to 80 years of pampering and attention. Out of our good treatment came something called Hamas. How dare the foolish Christians and Muslims compare us to them? They were our innocent children dancing next to their fence and taking vitamin D to strengthen their bodies from faltering in the face of the exchange of bullets. Between the two sides, looking for pigeons to urinate. How can you talk about our country when it sees that it is occupied? It must return to where it came from, just as we returned after we carried out famines and killing of indigenous people, apartheid, and the theft of gold and silver minerals, historical artifacts, and oil. We built Iraq and Afghanistan for them, but they are barbarians, and their influence on The citizens are truly horrific, and that child who was stabbed 26 times deserves that. We should bomb another hospital to commemorate the Holocaust. I don&#39;t know. They made me feel like I was the culprit. I just gathered them in a corner and hit them every now and then for 80 years. How do they respond to the same blow? Help us.\n",

For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.

            "&quot;Go educate yourself&quot; is appropriate advice for that ignorant young man.  The beheaded babies story has been thoroughly debunked.  An educated person would never have fallen for this lie in the first place :  babies on bayonets (WWI), Chopsticks through childrens ears (Vietnam), incubator babies (Kuwait, Gulf war 1), etc., all BS but some people never learn.  The &quot;rapes&quot; also turned out to be propaganda.  The Hamas attacks focused mostly on military  targets;  a good deal of Military equipment was destroyed, some captured. People were killed, hostages were taken, most of those were IDF, some were civilian.  All were taken to exchange for hostages held in Israeli prisons.  I would have skipped the civilians if I was in charge, but I wasn&#39;t. That&#39;s war, get over it.  Overall it was a good operation, certainly not any worse than a typical US, British or NATO operation in Nam (&#39;Kill them all, let God sort them out) or the ever popular wedding massacres in Iraq or the air and naval bombings of Libya. So what could possible justify such an attack?  Perhaps the expulsion and slaughter of over 500 towns and villages IN 1948.  Perhaps the continuing appropriation of the remaining Palestinian lands and the steady ethnic cleansing campaign, the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes, the bulldozing and appropriation of their houses, the filling of their water wells with cement,  the midnight IDF raids on their homes to carry their teenagers sons to prisons - never to be seen again ,  the destruction of their olive groves and burning of their crops, the periodic &quot;mowing&quot; of the &quot;grass&quot; and the insane hypocrisy of claiming victimhood on the rare occasion when the &quot;grass&quot; mows back.  There is no reasoning with people who believe that God himself commands them to steal the land of others and murder the victims.

            "Two problems: irrationality and missing three moral virtues.  Those who have difficulty accessing rational thinking struggle with negotiation and problem solving.  This leads to vilification and out shouting instead of engagement.  They cannot operate in an environment where two nearly equal parties engage to find a win-win scenario or at least a compromise.  They do not see the benefit of incremental gains such as the orthodontist deploys by tightening braces on teeth over time.  <br><br>They seek to overpower so that they do not have to face any losses or address any resistance.  <br><br>Once power is surrendered to them, their lack of problem solving abilities ensures that they cannot deliver quality and enduring solutions.  Without skills  to problem solve or negotiate well, they cannot achieve the best benefit of rational thinking - competence. <br><br>Jonathan Haidt has revealed the six moral virtues that thriving societies are built upon in his book, The Righteous Mind (a must read).  Those who lean left only subscribe to the three common moral virtues.  The three that they miss encourage people to give care to how they do things and value families and communities.  This is why leftists adopt ‘ends justifies the means’ tactics so easily.  This ignorance is also why they get surprised when the general population does not follow their lead such as the results of the recent Australian referendum.  <br><br>Being helpless or too arrogant to understand their failures, they start looking for nonsensical ways to blame someone else instead of understanding that their actions and policies are legitimately immoral to the majority of the world’s population.<br><br>Seriously, read the book- you can thank me later for its profound insights.\n",

            "This is from the Globe @abdallah_fayyad~It is not &quot;Israeli occupation&quot; that Hamas and the PLO resent. It is the existence of any Jewish state, no matter how small. In 1947 the United Nations voted to create two states, one Jewish and one Arab, in what had been British Palestine. The Jews agreed. The Arabs launched what they called a &quot;war of extermination&quot; to prevent the birth of a Jewish state. Miraculously, Israel survived the Arab onslaught. That is what its enemies call &quot;the occupation.&quot; Eighteen years ago, Israel expelled all the Jews who were living in the Gaza Strip and transferred the entire territory to the Palestinian Authority. It was the perfect opportunity for Palestinians to build a flourishing and peaceful state, unimpeded by Jewish &quot;occupiers.&quot; Instead, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas vowed to use Gaza as a base for more and more terror. They kept their word. The nearly 1,000 Israelis shot, hacked, burned, raped, beheaded, and tortured to death this past week are only the latest victims. For many, many centuries, Jews suffered unimaginable cruelty, oppression, enslavement, and violence. Often they had good reason to hate their rulers. But 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 did they respond by cutting off babies&#39; heads, burning families alive in their homes, or opening fire on young people at a dance festival. And 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 did they inculcate in their children a passionate yearning for the genocide of non-Jews. It has been said often, but it bears repeating: If Hamas and the PLO were to lay down their weapons, there would be no more violence. If Israel were to lay down its weapons, there would be no more Israel. There are 22 Arab countries and 55 majority-Muslim countries in the world. There is only one small Jewish country. But for Israel&#39;s enemies, that has always been one too many.\n",

Israel has been more accomodative to the Palestinians in its &quot;territory&quot; than any of the Arab countries around it.

            "The Jews are not colonizers in the land of Israel. It is their indigenous land from 4000 years ago, and they came back, after being rejected by the rest of the world. If anything, the vast majority of Arab habitats in Israel today, are offsprings of Arabs, who came to Israel AFTER the Jews started to return to Israel, around the year 1882. Before that, even Mark Twain, who visited Palestine in 1867, said that he found a barren land, empty of habitants. And Winston Churchill, who traveled to mandatory Palestine, said that masses of Arabs come to Israel, from territories surrounding Palestine (where today&#39;s Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt are located). They came because of the job opportunities, that were created by the coming of the Jews to the land. And when the 1948 war came, many of the Arabs left back to the same territories their grandparents came from. Only there, they were no longer considered welcome, they were considered Palestinian refugees, only because the Arab nations of the region, wanted to use them as pawns, to eliminate Israel&#39;s right to exist. So please, if you are siding with Hamas, you are NOT siding with &quot;decolonization&quot;. You are siding with the brutal carnage and raping of women, children, and babies.

Only these countries can assure muslims of a better future because of the lack of islam.<br><br>Muslims are better reminded that Islamophobia was or is conceived by islam itself. Read the Quran and Sahih Hadith, it&#39;s replete with hatred against non muslims and even against muslims whom islamic sacred text viewed as Not Muslim Enough. Likewise, Naziphobia was conceived by the Nazis as Nazi ideology called for the subjugation and oppression of races who&#39;re Non White.<br><br>In islamic paradise, muslim government enacted laws that are designed to oppress non muslims (with the exception of Indonesia). Such laws are the anti apostasy laws and anti blasphemy laws. The former allowed the state  to prosecute and execute muslim apostates. More often than not, these muslim apostates will be murdered on the streets by muslim vigilantes who normally are employed and given protection by the state. Whilst the latter enabled muslims to insult the religion of non muslims. And any non muslims who dare respond to such insult will either be murdered on the streets by muslim vigilantes or be prosecuted and executed by the state. If the argument of muslims and their government with regards to legislating anti apostasy laws represent a legitimate attempt at mantaining the identity of their people as muslim society or community, then all non muslim world Must Ban islam in their respective countries. Any non muslims in their country who embraced islam Must be Forced to migrate to islamic paradise. Any muslim migrants who migrate to non muslim world must renounce islam before they are allowed into any non muslim countries. This will be the most logical answer to radical islam. Our world will be a world better without these radical muslims or political islam.<br><br>When muslims constantly pray to their Allah to punnish oppressors, the True God, the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob aka the Lord God of Israel, who is Supposedly the Source of Justices, answered muslims prayers and punnish these oppressive rulers and their people who all are muslims. Take a good look at muslim world today. Muslims bomblast themselves in crowded places, in Mosques, at muslims prayer gatherings in open space, in Churches, in temples etc. Muslim parents teaches and trained their young children how to handle assault rifles. They also trained young children proper techniques of mounting explosives on their body to become suicide bombers. By now, will muslims consider these depraved and diabolical act of abusing and exploiting young children as sheer evil? Also, muslim rulers are not only oppressive but corrupt. Open up your eyes and mind and you will find that muslim rulers are amongst the wealthiest people in our planet after they plundered state wealth and blame USA and Israel for the miseries and poverty they inflicted upon their very own citizens.\n",

Now I am just confused because all the people are saying that Israel is innocent and free Israel and all but do you guys dont know the full story of anything I mean Israel has taken the land of Palestine for the last 70 years and that they are not allowing Muslims to live properly in the land of GAZA they are killing and suffering the MUSLIM population of Gaza for the last 70 years do you guys get it for the last 70 yearss!!!!!!!!!!!  I mean how much can a society handle torture guys? I mean this still does not give them the right to kill innocent people and as a Muslim I believe that even if you are in suffering you should not inflict harm on others you should always stay calm that is how Islam works. But everyone saying that Palestine are evil and vile have you seen what the people of Israel have been doing to the Palestines for the last 70 years the average age of Muslims in Gaza was 18 because Israel did not provide food clean water work for the Muslims. So before saying that one side is good the other is totally right is not right in this situation I would say that the Government of both countrys are at fault.<br>I DONT SUPPORT THE KILLING OF INNOCENT BUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAS DONE FAR WORSE TO THE PEOPLE OF PALESTINE FOR THE LAST 70 YEARS, PEOPLE SHOULD ALSO KNOW THE EVIL SIDE OF ISRAEL TOO.\n",

            "“In 1947, the United Nations approved a plan to divide British Palestine into two mostly independent countries, one for Jews called Israel and one for Arabs called Palestine. Jerusalem, holy city for Jews and Muslims, was to be a special international zone.  On the eve of May 14, 1948 the Arabs launched an air attack on Tel Aviv, which the Israelis resisted. This action was followed by the invasion of the former Palestinian mandate by Arab armies from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt. &quot;  The Palestinians with the help of all those militaries were bent on killing all Israelis in that war.  The Palestinians continue to provoke as do the Israelis.   So, the question becomes, who continues to harrass and kill the other?  Peace or no peace, If  you break into someone&#39;s home and start killing everyone in it, does that need a justification for defense and retaliation?

So the fool, as distinct from the scoundrel, is completely self-satisfied. In fact, they can easily become dangerous, as it does not take much to make them aggressive.

Unbelievable. <br><br>Palestinians dancing and celebrating when Jews or Americans are slaughtered. When this American man just brutally attacked a Muslim woman and stabbed her young son to death, did Americans pass out candy and laugh and celebrate? NO. <br><br>The most evil, barbaric, unthinkable acts of terror are committed by Hamas against the innocent and weak. Hamas steals all the resources from the people in order to create weapons instead of benefiting the citizens. They hold terrorist training camps for even children. They brainwash even toddlers and teach them to stab/hate/destroy Jewish people. They teach children it is an honor to sacrifice their own life as a suicide bomber. They use the Palestinians as human shields. <br><br>If you claim that every horrific inhuman atrocity Hamas commits is JUSTIFIED, that&#39;s like saying disagreement with a district-wide school policy justifies a school shooting massacre. <br><br>Even if I can almost bring myself to accept the reality of the depraved depths of evil, I can&#39;t wrap my mind around anyone literally SEEING and DEFENDING/DENYING such perverse acts of evil and destruction.\n",

Currently, the Hamas government punishes all men who are convicted of having engaged in homosexual acts with up to 10 years in prison.  Oct. 2022: &quot;The severed head and decapitated torso of a 25-year-old Palestinian [Gay man] were discovered on the side of a road in the occupied West Bank, police said Friday, confirming gruesome details of a killing that shocked Palestinian society.<br><br>But accounts that the victim, Ahmad Abu Murkhiyeh, was a gay man who feared persecution for his sexuality and had sought asylum in Israel two years ago turned the terrible crime into a socially and politically explosive case.<br><br>It was unclear how Abu Murkhiyeh wound up in Hebron, the conservative West Bank city that he had reportedly fled. Palestinian police officials told The Associated Press on Friday that Abu Murkhiyeh’s head and torso were found near his family’s house.&quot;<br><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-immigration-west-bank-gay-rights-ce95f6903faf461502cc0800b272b159\">https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-immigration-west-bank-gay-rights-ce95f6903faf461502cc0800b272b159</a><br><br>2019. &quot;The Palestinian Police Authorities in the West Bank banned the activities of queer and feminist rights organization Al Qaws as requested by residents in report of &#39;suspicious&#39; activities, however, this law was later retired following internacional backlash. On the Gaza strip, there is no information about the topic.&quot;<br><a href=\"https://www.equaldex.com/region/palestine\">https://www.equaldex.com/region/palestine</a><br><br>&quot;Regarding child marriage in Palestine, according to the most recent 2014 survey, 15% of women,<br>20-24 years old, were married before the age of 18 years. However, this percentage jumped<br>to 20% when calculating the prevalence in the Gaza Strip alone. The Palestinian president in<br>2019 declared a law to prevent early marriage. However, the statement about bringing exemption from court acts as permission to early marriage, as in Palestine, no girl can decide by herself. [NO girl or boy could decide to be queer and marry same sex] The family will select and bring permission from the court, and the marriage will happen without the girl&#39;s consent. Globally, around 12 million [Muslim] women were married before they turn 18,<br>although there is a 15% reduction in the prevalence of child marriage during the last decade.<br><br>FGM ( Female Genital Mutilation )... in communities that lie closer to Egypt&#39;s borders, in the south of the Gaza Strip, the FGM is influenced by Egyptian society. No studies have been done on these communities, but the driving factors are similar to the driven causes in the Egyptian community. Linking it to the religion, social norms, and protecting the girl&#39;s reputation.<br> I studied for my medical degree in Egypt, and I was introduced to very little information about FGM during my studies. However, Egypt made progress in reducing FGM prevalence, especially after engaging religious bodies such as Al-Azhar Al-sharif, which contributed to publishing important articles to end FGM and other harmful practices. Therefore, the factors that need to be addressed in FGM abandonment are addressing social norms and addressing the gaps in medical education.&quot;<br>Reem Elfarra, University of Leeds, NHS, United Kingdom<br><a href=\"https://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2021/adolescent-health/pdf/M8-Reem-Elfarra.pdf\">https://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2021/adolescent-health/pdf/M8-Reem-Elfarra.pdf</a><br><br>Stop.

Soon, many deceptions will come, which will complete the pagan communist push which we have been seeing consume the west in many ways for years, especially since Covid, and also through the agendas that drove the Voice which sort control over land rights, and implementation of cultural heritage.  All too complex for lefties to even comprehend, for the dark spiritual realm that has brainwashed them, has totally consumed them.  Demonic possession is indicative of irrational thoughts, confused reasoning, inability to see or feel empathy or accept solutions grounded in moral righteousness, true love and compassion. Ultimately the demonic can not forgive, and heal, and it certainly can not obtain or recognise the Wisdom or love of God.  The fruit of all this is the world we see, where increasingly there is a growing divide between good and evil. Right and wrong, where a growing number of people are justifying evil, wrong - as the only good. Totality totally flipped, which is a sign of demonic possession.  Sadly I can say this is only going to get worse, because all these events are leading up the presentation of the antichrist. A man of deceit, who will be presented on the world stage as the “man of peace”.  He will be the false messiah of the Jews, the Mahdi of the Islamic… he will deceive many with false humility, false charity etc… false miracles… he will ultimately say he is Jesus Christ returned. Yet he will be the ultimate liar, deceive with hypnotic powers.  He will present Mas0nic solutions to the worlds problems, which have been delicately created.  The mark, to be able to buy and sell using the the new global currency once the fiat system collapses will be one of he’s offers. A credit system based on socialist communist ideology.  Sadly many will accept it thinking it’s a good idea.  Do not accept it, it will remove your free will and completed the Transhumanism agenda of the mRNA jabs.

Back in the mid-1980s, Cohen even wrote an official report to his superiors warning them not to play divide-and-rule in the Occupied Territories, by backing Palestinian Islamists against Palestinian secularists. “I … suggest focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before this reality jumps in our face,” he wrote.<br>They didn’t listen to him.<br>The Israelis helped build up a militant strain of Palestinian political Islam, in the form of Hamas and its Muslim Brotherhood precursors; then, the Israelis switched tack and tried to bomb, besiege, and blockade it out of existence.\n",
